# 🚀 App Store Readiness Checklist

**Date:** December 11, 2024  
**Status:** 🔴 **CRITICAL FIX NEEDED** - Database Migration Required

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: Must Fix Before Submission**

### **1. Database Migration - BOOKING TRIGGER FIX** ⚠️ **BLOCKING**

**Status:** ❌ **NOT APPLIED**

**Issue:** The booking creation is failing due to a database trigger error:
```
"FOR UPDATE is not allowed with aggregate functions"
```

**Fix Required:**
1. Apply migration: `supabase/migrations/20251212000001_fix_booking_trigger_for_update.sql`
2. This MUST be applied to production database before app store submission
3. Without this, bookings will fail for all non-developer accounts

**How to Apply:**
```bash
# Option 1: Supabase CLI
cd /Users/yaseenkhalil/Downloads/barber-app-main
supabase db push

# Option 2: Supabase Dashboard
# 1. Go to SQL Editor
# 2. Copy contents of: supabase/migrations/20251212000001_fix_booking_trigger_for_update.sql
# 3. Run the SQL
```

**Verification:**
- Try creating a booking with a non-developer account
- Check logs for: `✅ Payment intent created`
- Booking should complete successfully

**Time Required:** 5 minutes  
**Priority:** 🔴 **CRITICAL - BLOCKS SUBMISSION**
